# Getting Started with RetailDAO

Welcome to **Retail DAO**, a decentralized autonomous organization empowering retail communities through collaborative governance, fair tokenomics, and rewarding incentives. This page is your entry point to understanding and joining our ecosystem.

## What is RetailDAO?

**Retail DAO** is a decentralized platform uniting retail investors, crypto founders, projects, and contributors to create a transparent, community-driven retail ecosystem. Built on blockchain technology, we prioritize fairness, collaboration, and innovation.

## Key Aspects of RetailDAO

### Governance

Retail DAO operates through decentralized governance, where token holders propose and vote on key decisions. Our governance model ensures:

- **Transparency**: All proposals and votes are recorded on-chain, and documented on our GitHub repo.
- **Participation**: Any token holder can submit proposals or vote.
- **Structure**: Governed by a smart contract-based system with defined roles.

Learn more in our [Governance Docs](https://github.com/RetailDAO/Docs/tree/main/Governance).

### Tokenomics

Our native token, **$RETAIL$**, powers the Retail DAO ecosystem. Key features include:

- **Total Supply**: [1 000 000 000].
- **Distribution**: [65% community treasury, 21.75% 4 future Airdrops, 8% First Main Airdrop, 4.5% contributors team, 0.75 For Early Discord Participants].
- **Utility**: Used for governance, rewards, and accessing premium features.

Explore details in our [Tokenomics Docs](https://github.com/RetailDAO/Docs/tree/main/Token_Ecosystem).

### Incentives

RetailDAO rewards active participation to foster a thriving community:

- **Contributor Incentives**: Receive tokens for development, content creation, or community moderation.
