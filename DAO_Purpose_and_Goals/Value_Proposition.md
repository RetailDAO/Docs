# Problem that we aim to solve

The overwhelming influx of information and the sheer volume of new projects and investment opportunities make it impossible for any individual to stay fully informed or thoroughly research every option. Retail DAO addresses this challenge by uniting retail investors, harnessing the collective intelligence of the community to identify the most promising opportunities in the space. Through collaboration, we can leverage the power of the crowd to make smarter, more informed investment decisions.
