# Retail DAO Governance

## Overview
Retail DAO operates a hybrid governance model combining on-chain and off-chain mechanisms to ensure transparent, community-driven decision-making. We use:
- **Aragon**: On-chain voting for binding proposals
- **Snapshot**: Off-chain proposals for gasless voting
- **Discord Polls**: Community sentiment and informal input

## Governance Process
1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - **Who**: ProMember or VIPMember token holders (see [Token Details](docs/token.md))
   - **Where**: Snapshot or Discord’s Governance Zone
   - **Requirements**: Clear title, description, and rationale
2. **Discussion**:
   - Conducted in Discord’s Governance Zone or Snapshot comments
   - Open for 48–72 hours
3. **Voting**:
   - **On-chain (Aragon)**: For binding decisions (e.g., fund allocation)
   - **Off-chain (Snapshot)**: For strategy or non-binding proposals
   - **Discord Polls**: For quick community feedback
   - Voting power is based on $RETAIL token holdings
4. **Execution**:
   - Approved on-chain proposals are executed via Aragon smart contracts
   - Off-chain outcomes are implemented by the core team or delegated members

## Membership Tiers
- **Verified Member (Basic)**: 20K $RETAIL, Access to the tokengated channels iin the Aalpha Zone and Governance Zone.
- **ProMember**: 100K $RETAIL, same as verified Member.
- **VIPMember**: 250K $RETAIL, Same as Pro + Access to VIP-only chat channel. 

**More features are intended to be added to both Pro Member tier and VIP tier memberships.** 

## Transparency
- All proposals, votes, and outcomes are publicly logged:
  - On-chain: Base Network explorer
  - Off-chain: Snapshot and Discord archives
- Smart contracts are audited, with reports in `docs/audits.md`
- Governance updates are documented here and announced on Discord
